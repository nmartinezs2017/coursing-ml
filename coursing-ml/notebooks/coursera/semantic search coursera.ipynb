We'll learn about different data representations, including strings, lists, and tuples, that form the core of all Python programs.  We will also teach you how to access files, which will allow you to store and retrieve data within your programs. These concepts and skills will help you to manipulate data and write more complex Python programs.By the end of the course, you will be able to write Python programs that can manipulate data stored in files.  This will extend your Python programming expertise, enabling you to write a wide range of scripts using Python  This course uses Python 3.  While most Python programs continue to use Python 2, Python 3 is the future of the Python programming language. This course introduces basic desktop Python development environments, allowing you to run Python programs directly on your computer.

While population health is largely produced outside of healthcare settings themselves, the functioning of healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness, injury, and other impairments, is essential for people’s wellbeing. Yet, healthcare can be and often is insufficiently accessible, responsive, and efficient for different members of society. How can healthcare provision and society be bridged?Through the exploration of a combination of theoretical and practical perspectives, this online course highlights the necessity of a dialogue and collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the public at large. Course participants will critically explore challenges posed by disjunctures between healthcare and society, analyze both benefits and unintended consequences of bridging the two, and propose ways to accomplish the bridging in practice of healthcare provision.  After completion of this course you will be able to:  1.\tRecognize disjunctures between healthcare provision and society 2.\tBe aware of consequences of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society 3.\tIdentify opportunities for bridging healthcare provision and society, using a biosocial approach to health 4.\tAnalyze cases of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society, and propose opportunities for bridging 5.\tRecognize the historical trends of scientification, professionalization, and medicalization, in the relations between medicine, health care, and society.  This course was developed by a consortium of five universities: Maastricht University, National Research Tomsk State University, National University of \"Kyiv-Mohyla Academy\",  National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, and Siberian State Medical University within the framework of BIHSENA project.

It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.ESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Course Learning Objectives  By the end of the course, learners should be able to:  •\tArticulate key public health concepts related to global health; •\tAnalyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\t •\tDiscuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways; •\tAssess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries;  •\tOutline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns; •\tReview key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Value Added of the Course  The course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health  For almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see:   - Required readings - Recommended readings - Recommended videos  We have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.  For each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.  In addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session.   The first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.  The second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.  Learners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.  We have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.\n",

And how should healthcare organisations collaborate?These are central questions in this course. In answering them, we depart from a recognition of the impact of three crucial global shifts in health care governance: 1) the change in focus from cure to population health, 2) the increased attention to social determinants of health,  and 3) the stronger involvement of non-governmental healthcare organisations in service delivery networks.   The course is unique in combining the Population Health perspective with theories of healthcare system governance. It takes a ‘multi-level’ perspective: the participant will look at healthcare governance from different angles in  the healthcare system as a whole: from the global and national level, to networks of organisations, to individual care organisations, and finally to the healthcare professional. All these actors should function well to optimize accessible, affordable and high quality of care. To attain these goals, specific managerial network and leadership skills are required.\n",

How do you transform your healthcare practice in such a way that you are not only able to provide proactive care but you are also able to improve the health of populations at risk?In this course you will learn how to apply the panel management approach to tackle these questions in order to change from reactive to proactive care.   You will learn how to empanel (patient)groups that share the same risk and how you can allocate the appropriate intervention to each panel of patients. From there you will dive into ways to transform current workflows for optimal in-reach and out-reach care both at the cultural and behavioral change level. As a final step you will learn how to evaluate both effectiveness and process based on the triple aim. This will give you insight into what can be improved in the next panel management cycle.
